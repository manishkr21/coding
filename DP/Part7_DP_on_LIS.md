### Longest Increasing Subsequence |(DP-41)
```diff
! Note : given an array, any contigous and non-contiguos "ordered" elements are known as subsequence of the given array.
! Method used for subsequence is "pick/took" or "not pick/not took"
 arr1 = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
 LIS = [2,3,7,101]   len = 4
 LIS = [2,3,7,18]    len = 4
 
 arr2 = [8,8,8]
 LIS = [8]    len = 1 {clearly state that increasing}
